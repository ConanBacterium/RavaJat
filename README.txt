Made in Monterrey, Mexico January 2014 (the code is not updated for the newer java versions)

The RAT is quite simple, it allows people to use the shell of the computer RavaJat is running on. 

Syntax:
shell <Command> <Command arguments> 			// Will execute the <Command> and <Command arguments>  on every machine that is running RavaJat
whatOS							// Will tell what OS RavaJat is running on

Communication with RavaJat is through the IRC server "freenode" at channel "#kykkeliky"




I apologise for the profanity in comments and method-names :)
